Welcome to the Land Battle Chess Game!

This game has three modes: singleplayer, multiplayer, and multiplayer in Dark mode. In singleplayer mode, the player plays against an AI player; in multiplayer, two players can connect to one server using socket and play against each other. After selecting the mode, the user will be able to rearrange their layout. When layout is finished, the game starts. Capture the flag to win!


To run the game, you need to first run "server.py" on your terminal. The program will automatically get your IP address and select an available port. Then, open a new terminal window and run "__init__.py". Copy and paste (or type in) the numbers shown in the server window. You can create another instance of the game by running "__init__.py" on another computer (or another terminal window). Note that the server hosts at most two clients. No additional libraries are needed to run the game.
